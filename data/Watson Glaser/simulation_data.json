At least one machine must be operated by 12 workers (remember – both ends of the range must exist; otherwise, the premises would be contradicted). The rest could be operated by the minimal number of 6 workers. 19*6*3 + 1*12*3 = 378 (number of machines*number of workers*number of shifts a day). The correct minimal number of workers per day is therefore 378.Note: To emphasize the comment about range, here is another example: If a shopping mall is open 8 to 12 hours a day every week, at least one day a week it must be open 8 hours, and at least one day a week it must be open 12 hours. Otherwise, the range would be different. This is why, when calculating the minimum numbers of workers in the question, you cannot assume all 20 machines are operated by six workers, because then the premise would not mention a range. If there is a range – both limits must appear at least once.",
